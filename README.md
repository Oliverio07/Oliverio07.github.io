## Objective

_What and why are we doing this?_

As a software engineer student, I'd like to have a porfolio to show my web development projects

## Goals

- Make a web development porfolio
- Upload my own projects

## Non-Goals

- Make it a blog
- Upload personal content

## Detailed Design

_- Is there any code that can be reusable?_

Yes, these CSS libraries are great:

- [PaperCSS](https://www.getpapercss.com)
- [Animate.css](https://animate.style)

## Solution 1

### **Frontend**

_Html_

_Css_

_Sass_

_Javascript_

_PaperCSS_

_Animate.css_

### **Backend**

_PHP_

## Solution 2 [Preferred]

### **Frontend**

_Html_

_Css_

_Sass_

_Javascript_

_PaperCSS_

_Animate.css_

### **Backend**

_Firebase_

## Solution 3

### **Frontend**

_Html_

_Css_

_Sass_

_Javascript_

_PaperCSS_

_Animate.css_

## Considerations

_Concerns / trade-offs / tech debt_

- Solution 1: It is a great choice, but I currently don't know any PHP, so it'll take time until I learn it.

- Solution 2: The same as solution 1, I don't know any Firebase, but it'll be easier than PHP to link the contact form. That's why it's preferred.

- Solution 3: This solution could be great, but it won't have back end code, and contact form will be deleted.

## Metrics

_What data do you need to validate before launching this feature?_

- Front end is finished [ ]
- Back end is finished [ ]
- Preferred domain is available [ ]
- Have a host [ ]
